# Drag & drop demo
This is a prototype of a drag&drop based UI, built with Vue 3, Tailwind and Vite.

Online demo: http://vue-drag-and-drop.vercel.app

## Details
The idea behind the project was to use vanila-JS based solution for DOM manipulation and drag&drop interaction, which is then bound to the application written in Vue that takes care of data flow.
